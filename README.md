# aimbooster-autoclicker
autoclicker for aimbooster.com

My first project on github, so im testing the waters with this one

...

i used it with 1080p resolution inside of a maximized(not f11 mode) chrome browser window

run with python, some libraries need to be installed first, hold q to end the clicking and moving of a cursor
